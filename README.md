### Dynamic frontend guessing game using the jQuery library.

#### Here's how the app works:

* There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
* The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
* When they do click one, the player's score counter is updated.
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
* When the game begins again, the player is shown a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values and the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
* The number of games the player wins and loses are tracked and displayed in a scoreboard.
